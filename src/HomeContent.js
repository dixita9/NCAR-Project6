         Welcome! This website is designed to assist you in evaluating whether 
         your science objective is well-suited for GPU-enabled computing. 
	 The assessment comprises four pages containing a series of questions 
         that you will answer in sequence. Upon completion, the summary page 
         will provide tailored feedback based on your responses. Should your 
         science objective align favorably with GPU-enabled computing, the 
         feedback will include a set of steps you can take to initiate the GPU 
         porting process.

         <br></br><br></br>You are not required to answer all the questions 
         in one sitting; feel free to leave the tab open and return later if
         you need to take a break. Your answers will be automatically saved
	 in the form, ensuring your progress is preserved.</p>
